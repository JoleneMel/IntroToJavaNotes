		Object-Oriented Programming is an Imperative Programming Paradigm.  

		Let's step back a little bit, and give you some background on programming paradigms.

		Definitions:  

		    A paradigm is a way, or a method that can be used to solve a problem. 
		    A programming paradigm is the way that one solves a given problem (or task), by programming.  Also described as a framework that defines how problems can be solved.
		    A programming language (e.g. Java, Pascal, C#, etc.) is separate from a programming paradigm. A programming language is a tool that is used to write code to solve problems.


		There are a number of programming paradigms.  Each one has a set of rules and principles.  If a programming language is going to support a programming paradigm,  the programming 
		language must support or adhere to those rules and principles    The programming paradigm is enforced by a programming language compiler during the program compilation stage.  
		Each programming paradigm is simply a different approach to solve a problems, and provides a style and organization to do so.  

		Here is a brief overview of a few Programming Paradigms:

		Imperative:  These types of paradigms are command driven. 
		Details:  Support of an imperative programming paradigm looks like this:

		        The program code directs the program execution as sequence of statements executed one by one.
		        The statements will direct the computer to perform a tasks.
		        The programmer designs and programs each statement in detail, and each of those statements will direct what is to be accomplished, by specifying how it is to be done.
		        A program, in an imperative programming paradigm, is simply a set of statements, run in order, that execute to completion.

		Types:  Two common imperative programming paradigms are as follow:

		        Procedural -- Based on a set of procedures (also referred to as functions, methods or subroutines).  Each procedure, function, method or subroutine performs a 
		        specific operation.  C, FORTRAN, and Pascal support this paradigm.

		        Object-Oriented --  All program components are objects.   The unique feature here is that an object contains properties and functions.  All data and associated 
		        methods are combined into a single object.  Some would say that this is an extension of procedural programming concepts.   Java supports this paradigm.


		Declarative:  These types of paradigms are logic focused.
		Details: Support of a declarative programming paradigm looks like this:

		        The control flow is not the important part of this program, the logic of a computation is expressed, without describing the control flow of the computation.
		        Focused on achieving the end result.
		        This approach describes to what is to be done, instead of how it should be achieved.

		Types:

		        Functional -- based on mathematical functions.  Attempts to solve problems with composing functions as program components.  functions can be passed as 
		        arguments, and can also be returned as a value.  Pure functional languages, (e.g. Haskell) allow only pure functional programs.  However, some languages 
		        allow both functional and procedural programs, and Java is one of these programming languages, though to effectively use functional programming in Java, 
		        it is advisable to use Java 8 or later.

		        Logic -- based on logic and control, or in other words facts and rules.  Control is defined as an order of rules.  In this type, logic defines what needs 
		        to be solved whereas the control defines how it should be solved.  Prolog is an example of this paradigm.  


		Note:  many of the current programming languages are general purpose languages, and as such, they support more than one programming paradigm.

		Our focus here is on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  There are a number of programming languages that support the object oriented programming paradigm, 
		including Java, JavaScript, C3, Ruby, and others.   

		There are four pillars of OOP which are:

		    Encapsulation -- Data Security -- binding related data and methods together into objects -- data hiding (hide the unnecessary).
		    Inheritance -- Code reusability -- acquiring the existing functionality of a parent class, with the ability to add additional functionality and features 
		    into the child class -- an object can inherit some properties and methods from another object.
		    Polymorphism --  Many Forms --  A single object can have multiple behaviors, or respond in different ways to the same function.  
		    Abstraction -- Present a simplified view -- Hide the complexity from the user (show only what is necessary).

		Each pillar is essential, and important, but these pillars are also dependent upon each other.  Without encapsulation, abstraction and inheritance are not possible. 
		Additionally, polymorphism does not exist without inheritance.   Each of these pillars is essential to the paradigm, and together define object-oriented programming.   
		OOP as a whole functions through objects the contain properties and methods, and the relationships of these objects with other objects.
