		What is OOP?


				Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm.  Java is an Object Oriented Language, which means that it supports OOP, providing features that 
				support and implement the Four Pillars of OOP. 

				In OOP,  objects are the key construct in our programming, and these objects contain properties and functionality.  Instead of writing code all in one place, 
				we structure our program into objects.  Each object will contain relevant properties and functionality, which is code that is structured into methods that 
				can be used over and over.  

				 In OOP, programs are written by creating objects that contain both data (properties)  and methods (functionality),  in contrast with procedural programming 
				where data exists, and  procedures and methods perform operations on the data.

				It takes time to start to think of data as being stored in an object which also contains all of the methods written for that object.  Another way to explain 
				this is to think of an object, and imagine that everything that you need (data or methods) is accessible anytime you reference that object.  If you have 
				access to the object, you also have access to any available property and functionality that belong to that object.


				Terminology -- Classes vs. Objects:


				Classes are the mechanism by which we structure our code in OOP.

				    A Class is a blueprint, in which you create your properties and functionality.
				    An Object is the actual product developed from the blueprint.

				An Object is an instance of a Class!


				So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.  When we create an object from a class, that object will inherit everything in 
				the class, including the properties and functionality.


				Description of a Class and an Object created from the Class:

				Class:  Animal

				Properties:

				    name
				    weight
				    type
				    location

				Functionality:

				    describe()

				Object:  dog 

				A dog will be instantiated as an instance of the class, Animal.

				 Animal dog = new Animal();

				Preview:

				In the next chapter, 2. Classes, you will find a Java example that creates a class Animal, and creates a class AnimalMain, in which we have a main method, as 
				well as two objects created from the class Animal:  elephant and kangaroo.
