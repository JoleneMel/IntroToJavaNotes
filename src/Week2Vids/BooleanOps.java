		 * boolean data are data that can either be true or false some examples of boolean data in our
everyday life include answers to yes-or-no questions such as is it hot outside is the dinner finished are we
there yet the answers to these questions are either yes or no similar to boolean values of true or false the answers to
any of these questions or any question like it is typically used to determine a further action for example if it is hot outside
then we won't wear a snow coat if dinner is finished we will wash our hands and
get on to the table and if the answer - are we there yet is no than our children will entertain themselves for a few more
minutes and ask again in order to identify and evaluate boolean data in our code we can use boolean operators to
check things such as if a value is equal to another value whether a value is greater than or less than another value
or if multiple conditions are true together any of these comparisons will result in true or false and that is
called boolean logic to perform boolean logic we use boolean operators and when we combine boolean values and at least
one boolean operator we get a boolean expression and that expression will evaluate to another boolean value either
true or false some of the operators that we can work with are the Equality operator to check to see if two values
are equal we have the greater than and less than operators to see if something is greater than or less than another
value we have the logical and and or operators which allow us to combine multiple boolean expressions such as if
we're looking for two conditions like I want this and this or I want this or that and then when we put these all
together we can build complex boolean logic that allow our programs to make decisions so the reason that boolean
values are important is they help us make decisions right programming is all about looking at data manipulating that
data and doing something with it well that doing something with it part is all about making a decision without having
different logical paths we go if yes go this way if no go that way our programs are very useful so let's
take a look at some of the boolean expressions that we can have starting with the Equality operator
