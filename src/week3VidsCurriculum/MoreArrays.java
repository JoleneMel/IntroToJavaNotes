		 * Advanced Topic:
		 * What if you wanted to actually create a more robust Grade Book?   One that would take more Student(s), and store their grades inside the Student Object.

			Here we are going to explore an example that creates an Array of Objects.  In this case, we would like to create an Array to hold our Student data.  To accomplish this, 
			we must first define what a Student will look like to be able to declare a Student Class that will be used to create our Objects.

			Each Student will have a name, and an Array of grades.  It will also need a way to create an Object of type Student (a Constructor), and a method to describe a Student 
			(or print out the data corresponding to the student). 

			The next step will be to create an Array of type Student.  We will also use the Scanner to take data from the console to use to create our arrays, we will create each 
			Student Objects, and we will update that instance of an Object with the data that is input. 

			To reproduce this example, you will need to create a Java Project in Eclipse, and then create two Java classes within that Java Project.

			    Student.java -- a class in Java, but does not have a main method.  
			    GradeBook.java -- a class in Java with a main method.
